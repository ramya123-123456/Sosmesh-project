# Sosmesh-project
SOSMesh is an offline-first emergency alert mobile application built using React Native (Expo).
It allows users to create SOS alerts with priority levels, store alerts locally, view emergency history, and manage alerts even without internet access.

The current version focuses on UI, offline data handling, and emergency flow, with future plans to add no-signal communication using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, or SMS fallback.

⚠️ Demo Note: A dummy phone number is used for demonstration. No real number is required, and there is no risk when location permission is allowed.
